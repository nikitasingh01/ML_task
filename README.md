# ML_task
Image classification of handwritten characters

# Steps To Setup

1. Open a google colab.
2. Upload the .ipynb file ("Task_II.ipynb") to the colab.
3. Take both of the datasets (train.rar and train_t.rar) and upload them to the google colab environment.
4. Now run all the cells of the colaboratory (CTRL+F9) and check the output.
